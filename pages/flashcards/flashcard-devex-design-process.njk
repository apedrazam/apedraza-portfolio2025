<div class="problem-section">
  <h4>Problem addressed:</h4>
  <p>Right after joining Devex, I had to lead and redefine the working process of the design team.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-grid design-process">
  <div class="flashcard-section previous">
    <h4>Initial scenario:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Design work was done mainly as <span class="font-bold">part of the development process</span>.</li>
      <li>Previous design decisions were taken in <span class="font-bold">isolation between designers</span>.</li>
      <li>All the <span class="font-bold">insight</span> from business came <span class="font-bold">from 2 people</span>: VP of Product and Data Director.</li>
      <li>Most of the <span class="font-bold">knowledge</span> from design was lost and <span class="font-bold">scattered</span> across the company files.</li>
      <li><span class="font-bold">Research done punctually</span> for bigger projects and not as a continuous process.</li>
      <li>Complaints about the <span class="font-bold">lack of visibility</span> of design work and concerns on its feasibility.</li>
      <li>Design team was from time to time a <span class="font-bold">bottleneck within the product</span> team process.</li>
      <li>Mainly <span class="font-bold">ad hoc communication</span> between designers and other stakeholders.</li>
      <li><span class="font-bold">Lack of design consistency</span> between different sections of the product.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="flashcard-section actions">
    <h4>Actions taken:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Leading and defining a new design culture focused on <span class="font-bold">user and business needs</span>.</li>
      <li><span class="font-bold">Continuous catch-up</span> within the design team to keep alignment and sharing knowledge.</li>
      <li>Enabling direct communication channels with several business stakeholders.</li>
      <li>Centralizing <span class="font-bold">Figma as a source of truth</span> for design work and deliverables.</li>
      <li>Using <span class="font-bold">research methods</span> to support design decisions <span class="font-bold">before and after</span> delivery.</li>
      <li><span class="font-bold">Public definition of a design process</span> and establishment of Design Critique sessions.</li>
      <li><span class="font-bold">Iterative design process</span> to facilitate actionability and implementation speed.</li>
      <li>Promotion of <span class="font-bold">asynchronous communication</span> to reduce times between feedback loops.</li>
      <li>Creation of a <span class="font-bold">design system</span> to improve consistency and speed of delivery.</li>
    </ul>
