      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>As Devex grew, the design team faced challenges with an unclear design process and lack of collaboration between teams. This led to inconsistent user experiences and inefficient workflows.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="case-study-section">
      <h2>The Approach</h2>
      <p>I initiated a comprehensive review of our design process, focusing on collaboration points and identifying key areas for improvement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conducted stakeholder interviews across product, engineering, and business teams</li>
        <li>Mapped current processes and identified pain points</li>
        <li>Developed and tested new collaborative approaches with real projects</li>
        <li>Established clear documentation templates for design decisions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="case-study-section">
      <h2>The Outcome</h2>
      <p>The new design process improved cross-team collaboration and led to significant improvements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design implementation time reduced by 35%</li>
        <li>Cross-team collaboration increased significantly</li>
        <li>Design consistency improved across all products</li>
        <li>Clear documentation processes established for future work</li>
      </ul>
